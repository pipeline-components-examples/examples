_Examples for all Pipeline Components_

This repository contains examples for:

- Docker 
- Github Actions
- Gitlab CI
- Travis

In order to do so, this repository also contains configuration, code, data, or
text files to run tools with.

## Work in progress

Until all examples are complete, an overview of what has already been done is
available at: <https://hackmd.io/@pipeline-components/examples-worklist>.
